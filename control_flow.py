# Control flow with if, elif and else - loops
# We use elif or else if we have multiple conditions

# if weather == "thinking":
#    print("Enjoy the weather ") # If true, this line will be executed
#else:
#    print ("Opps sorry, something went wrong. Please try later") # If false, this line will be executed

# add a condition to use elif when the condition is False
